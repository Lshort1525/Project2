## Project Overview
    
    Visual Studio Code is a desktop coding program. Using this program the goal was to take the words that reflect one's view of community. The song lyrics are taken from Miranda Lambert's song, "The House That Built Me". The song has many parallels to my own childhood home. The lyrics speak about visiting someone's childhood home and rediscovering who they are. In the song there is a few lines that speak about how the father built their home, which my parents did as well in the 80's. It also refers to learning guitar in their back bedroom. This song was one of the first songs I learned when learning guitar in my own bedroom. The older I get the more this song hits home because it is filled with nostalgia.  

## Technical Overview

    Using Visual Studio Code, several HTML pages are created as well as a style.css file for the CSS styling. Each html has lyrics placed on them. Using The CSS has correlating classes that allow you to target specific objects. To make the wave motion that is created with the word "play", each  letter is seperated into indiviual div's. Then each div has an animation-fill-mode added to keep the letters in the last position of the animation, rather than resetting to the starting position. Once the class is set-up you can create a keyframe. Within the keyframe create a 0%, meaning the start, and a 50% indicating halfway through the animation. 50% is chosen instead of 100% because we want the letter to bounce back rather than stay in a higher position. Then going back to the class section of the csss the keyframes are targeting you can individually slighly delay the start time of each letter you recieve a wave effect.
